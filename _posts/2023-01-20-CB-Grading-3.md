- Sample 1 Explanation: This sample did fairly well, it implemeted the criteria met in a majority of the topics with fair explanation. However they did not hit some marks for abstraction and algorithm, and therefore they missed those points
- Sample 2 Explanation: This did not hit a lot of the marks on half the sections, and they missed out on those points. But they did meet criteria on some, so that's credit where it's earned
- Sample 3 Explanation: This was perfect, they hit all the marks with good details about it 
- Sample 4 Explanation: They only missed one point when they forgot to include algorithm implementation, but apart from that they were impeccable
