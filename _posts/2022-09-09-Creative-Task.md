description: A review process of utilizing AppLab.
categories: [markdown]
title: Creative Task with Process
--- 

- For my creative task this trimester, I'm going to showcase some of my creations and concepts for the video game I want to make in the future and use what I learn in this class to make a test game, and utilize what I learned in order to create it. 

-So far, I liked how the AppLab operated with its design and building block format of coding to make a showcase for my game concepts, and hopefully at some point, a demo or prototype of the game I want to make.

# Technical Requirements

-Using what I learned from making my own quiz with applab and its simple design and code based system, I could utilize the features it has in order to make some sort of code based system for not only the showcase, but the coding and game prototype as well, as long as I keep learning the basics in order to make such a thing happen. So this will most likely require a lot of text, images, event boxes, and coding with applab in general, and I can design the screen with text, images, and quiz questions. This will all be beneficial for my concept showcase

# What I need to learn 

-I learned the basics with my first Applab creation, but there are a LOT of different categories, all with their own individual functions that wildly differ based on category. So I would say that I would need to learn a lot more of these building blocks in order to mkae more advanced designs and better developed ones, and the resources provided will likely be more than enough to learn how to do some interesting designs and functions
