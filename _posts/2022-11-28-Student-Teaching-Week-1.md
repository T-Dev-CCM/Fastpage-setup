## Monday: 3.1 and 3.2 Variables, Assignments, and Data Abstractions 


- A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value, and can organize data by labeling it with a descriptive nam 

- It has 3 elements, name, value, and type


# Naming Variables 

- Do's: Keep it simple, easy to read. Diffferentiate the words with a capital letter, to make it easy to read. make sure they have enough specifics and not vague. Spaces are not a proper syntax. dashes and numbers are also improper syntax and should be avoided 

# Types of Data 

- Integers (Numbers) Text/string (A word) Boolean (Data that determines if something is true or false) 

- Lists of data can be stored in variables, and it is useful to print/retrieve specific values without creating a lot of variables, and wasily removing/adding/changing items into the list. 

# Assignments 

- The assignment operator allows program to change the value represented by a variable 

- Used to assign Values 

- The Value stored in a variable will always be the most recent value assigned 

- num1 = 5 
- num2 = 9 
- num1 = num2 

- 9 twice 

# Data Abstraction 

- Data Abstraction is a methof used to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren't being used in this situation 

# Lists and Strings 

- Lists = Ordered sequence of elements 

- Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index 

- Index = a way to reference the elements 

- 1: Green 
- 2: Blue 
- 3: Purple

- What is the purpose: They help manage complexity by giving a collection of data a name without referencing specific details  

- Lists allow for data abstraction, bundle variables together, store multiple elements, allows multiple related elements 

- 1. Assigning values to a list at certain indices 
- 2. Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable 
- 3. Assigning a copy of a list to another one 

- Index starts at 1, not 0 

- Homework: Make a program that utilizes lists as the primary function (quiz)
