# This week we continued to work on our projects for N@TM 

- Issues/Things I contributed this week: https://github.com/kayleehou/escaperoom/issues/3 

- Commits: https://github.com/T-Dev-CCM


- N@TM: Many people came to our project to see how it worked, and as I explained it, they were surprised at what we made worked. They would say 'Wow!' from being able to find whatevery superhero they thought of easily. Afterwards, I went out to look at some of the 3d animated renders outside, and all of them looked really high quality and really well made. I then went on to see ceramics' day of the dead skulls, and all of which were really well made and detailed.
