- Digital Divide (Good v bad computers/lack of internet or computer access)

- Google has access to all knowledge (we don't) all the greatest tools, unblocked websites, free software 



- People can empower themselves by finding ways to access technology for free, wether it be at school or any other way, and taking notes in an alternative way about the subject

- Empowered people can help by allowing the non empowered to look at their technology and even allow them to use it so they can get a firsthand experience at what they're learning

- Paper and red tape
