| Sample 1  | Purpose: 0/1 | Data Abstraction: 1/1 | Managing Complexity: 0/1 | Procedural Abstraction: 1/1 | Algorithm Implementation: 1/1 | Testing: 1/1 | Total Grade: 4/6 | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |   
| Sample 2  | Purpose: 1/1  | Data Abstraction: 1/1 | Managing Complexity: 1/1| Procedural Abstraction: 1/1 | Algorithm Implementation: 1/1  | Testing: 1/1 | Total Grade 6/6 |  

- Sample 1 Explanation: The student did not elaborate on the purpose of the program fully, as it was noticably short, and only tested it one time when it could have been further tested and elaborated on. Not only that, they failed to include any details or information about Managing Complexity at all. However, they shown clearly that it works when tested, they implemented their algorithms in detail, And abstraction for both Procedural and Data abstraction, they went into a lot of detail about their code and what each of its functions were.  

- Sample 2 Explanation: This student was very in depth and detailed about their algorithms and programming. In testing and purpose, both were fully talked about and detailed in depth, Abstraction also detailed in functionality and prodecures, along with detailed explanations of implementation and complexity.
