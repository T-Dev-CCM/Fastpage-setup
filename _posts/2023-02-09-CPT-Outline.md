# Category 1: Purpose 

- The purpose of my project is to inform the viewer of what is coming soon from my upcoming game, and to also recieve emails and store them for the option of promotional emails.  

# Category 2: Data Abstraction 

![](https://github.com/T-Dev-CCM/Fastpage-setup/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(301).png?raw=true)

- My code shown here is a database used to store the data (in this instance email) It calls on an API and all necessary data from it, and identifies the name of the variable as email, and the data stored in it will be the email itself. 

# Category 3: Managing Complexity 

- The list mentioned above manages complexity by storing the data and calling on API, and for the UI of my project is managed with image formatting. 

# Category 4: Procedural Abstraction 

![](https://github.com/T-Dev-CCM/Fastpage-setup/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(302).png?raw=true) 

- The Procedure for this line of code is that it imports the user and defines an API with a blueprint that requests, gets, and then detects if there is a UID and password, if there aren't it makes one. 

# Category 5: Algorithm Implementation 

-N/A 

# Category 6: Testing 

- TBD
