- Sample 1 Explanation: They only displayed the code working as it should, and not much else. There's no other complexity or data abstraction on the reports to provie context

- Sample 2 Explanation: This Submission meets all expectations. The Purpose is well made and detailed, the Abtraction elements and procedures are implemented greatly and are well detailed. Overall shows complexity and detail  

- Sample 3 Explanation: This submission was really well detailed in its procedures and abstraction, however it missed one point for not expressing the purpose of the code

- Sample 4 Explanation: This code did meet some expectations, but it could have been a lot more thorough and clear with the function of the code.
