## Our Project

- Our project is going to be a point and click like escape room where you're given objects, clues, and puzzles in order to escape an area. Here I'll go over what the project will look like, and what positive or negative impacts could be possible. 

# What we're going to do 

- For starters, we plan on designing our project in Applab. And by using that we will go into depth about the setting, the different possible endings in the game, and flesh out a good and lengthy story to go along with it. In order to make sure whoever's playing is engaged with it, we need a long series of events to take place and an environment to look at and interact with. 

# What we're not going to do

- We're not going to go really basic and simple. I made a prototype in vscode with 3 endings. It worked, but it still felt a bit barebones and not too fleshed out in comparison to what we have planned for our final project. If we want to make a project, at the very least it has to be fun and interesting to play. 

# Positive Impacts 

- Our project will use a lot of design and code elements in order to make our project have its own unique charm and design. And using applab, we have minimum limits to what we can code or design, 

# Negative Impacts

- Apart from my mental sanity, the only major negative impacts we could have are the theme of our project not make sense, not be enjoyable, and not meet the expectations of being good we originally had. There's also the possibility of any errors in code or design that can require a lot of adjusting in order to fix. 


- Overall, I just hope we can all come together and make a project with an end result we are all satisfied with.
