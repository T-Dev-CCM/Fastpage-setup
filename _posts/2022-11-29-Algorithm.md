## Algorithms  

- 1st Step, Condition (yes/no) and 2 decisions 

- 1st step, 2nd step, condition (Yes/no) If no, stop, of yes, repeatv

- Oval = Start/End 

- Arrow = A connector that shows relationships between the shapes 

- Parallelogram: Input/output 

- Rectangle: A process 

- Diamond: The decision/result 

# Basic Operations 

- You can use variables instead of numbers if you want to 

- The function uses order of operations to solve operations (Parenthesis, Multiply, Divide, Add/ Subtract) 

# Variables 

- Numerical Value can be stored in a variable 

- Reads RIGHT TO LEFT 

- num1 = 2
- num2 = 4
- num3 = 6
- num1 = num2 + num3      # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10
- num2 = num1 + num3      # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16
- # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6

# Strings 

- Strings are a collection of characters (numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc.)
