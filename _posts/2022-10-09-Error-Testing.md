## Error Testing 

# How to test an error 

- Step 1: Find the error 

- Error types: 2.1.1: A Logic error: Mistake in the algorithm causing it to bheave incorrectly 

- 2.1.2: A Syntax error: A mistake in the program where the programming language aren't followed (typos and whatnot ) and cannot run

- 2.1.3: A Run Time error: A mistake that occurs during program execution with the languages defining their own errors (divide by 0/innapropriate data type)

- 2.1.4: An overflow error: An error that occurs when a computer can't handle a number too big 

- Errors are really common and expected with programming 

- Test code for errors and list specifications in behavior

- Finally, the code is tested and tested and improved upon, then tested again, until fully revised and released.
